      # Two-Factor Authentication (MFA)

      Two-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account. In addition to your password, you need a second factor to log in.

      ## Available Methods

      - **Authenticator app** - Use an app like Google Authenticator or 1Password
      - **Security key** - Use Touch ID, Face ID, or a USB key

      ## Backup Codes

      When setting up MFA, you receive backup codes. Store these safely - you can use them if you don't have access to your normal verification method.

      # Setting Up Authenticator App

      ## What Do You Need?

      An authenticator app on your phone, for example:

      - Google Authenticator (free)
      - Microsoft Authenticator (free)
      - 1Password, Bitwarden, or Authy

      ## Setup

      1. Open the authenticator app on your phone
      2. Choose "Add account" or the + icon
      3. Scan the QR code that appears on screen
      4. Enter the 6-digit code shown in the app

      ## Logging In

      When logging in, open the app and enter the current 6-digit code. The code changes every 30 seconds.

      ## Problems?

      - **Code not working?** Check if your phone's time is set correctly
      - **Lost phone?** Use your backup codes or contact the administrator

      # Setting Up Security Key

      ## What Is a Security Key?

      A security key is a secure way to log in using:

      - **Touch ID / Face ID** - Built into your Mac, iPhone or iPad
      - **Windows Hello** - Fingerprint or facial recognition on Windows
      - **USB key** - A physical key like YubiKey

      ## Setup

      1. Click "Add security key"
      2. Your browser asks which type of key you want to use
      3. Choose "This device" for Touch ID/Face ID, or connect your USB key
      4. Confirm with your fingerprint, face, or by touching the key

      ## Passkeys (Synced Keys)

      Modern browsers can sync your key via iCloud or Google:

      - **iCloud Keychain** - Works on all your Apple devices
      - **Google Password Manager** - Works in Chrome on all devices

      This way you can use the same key on multiple devices.

      ## Multiple Devices

      You can register multiple security keys. Useful if you log in from different devices or want a backup.

      # Backup Codes

      ## What Are Backup Codes?

      Backup codes are one-time codes you can use if you don't have access to your normal verification method (phone lost, broken, etc.).

      ## Important

      - Each code only works once
      - Store them in a safe place (not on your phone!)
      - Print them or save them in a password manager

      ## Lost Codes?

      If you've used all your backup codes or lost them, you can create new ones in your profile settings. The old codes will then become invalid.

      ## Completely Locked Out?

      Contact the administrator. They can reset your MFA settings so you can set up again.
